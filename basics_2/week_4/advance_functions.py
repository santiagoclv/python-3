 There are two tricky things that can confuse you with default values. 
 The first is that the default value is determined at the time that 
 the function is defined, not at the time that it is invoked.

    Another warning:
    The second tricky thing is that if the default value is set to a mutable object, such as a list or 
    a dictionary, that object will be shared in all invocations of the function. 
    This can get very confusing, so I suggest that you never set a default value that
     is a mutable object. For example, follow the exceution of this one carefully.

    Keyword Parameters: with keyword-based parameter passing. This is particularly convenient when there are 
    several optional parameters and you want to provide a value for one of the later parameters while not providing a value for the earlier ones.

    As guidance:

    Use positional-only if you want the name of the parameters to not be available to the user. This is useful when parameter names have no real meaning, if you want to enforce the order of the arguments when the function is called or if you need to take some positional parameters and arbitrary keywords.

    Use keyword-only when names have meaning and the function definition is more understandable by being explicit with names or you want to prevent users relying on the position of the argument being passed.

    For an API, use positional-only to prevent breaking API changes if the parameterâ€™s name is modified in the future.
